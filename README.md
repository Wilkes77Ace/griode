You need to install fluidsynth.

You also need some soundfonts. For instance:
- [GeneralUser](http://www.schristiancollins.com/generaluser.php)
- [Fluid SoundFont](https://packages.debian.org/source/sid/fluid-soundfont)
- [Soundfonts4U](https://sites.google.com/site/soundfonts4u/)

The script `download-soundfonts.sh` will try to download a few soundfonts for you.

If mido doesn't work and you get weird errors, it might be a weird issue between
rtmidi and python-rtmidi or whatever.
